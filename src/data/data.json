Honestly, we are very satisfied and happy with the results (it looks more elegant). Especially for us who are new in the Culinary Industry and still a small and medium enterprise (SME), this makes our brand appear more prepared and professional with a website that is linked to our social media, Papanots.id. In addition to being timely, working with Dedi Indrawan (Build Web) was very comfortable in terms of communication, quick response, and excellent service. What we wanted and aimed for in the creation of the website has been met with our expectations, expressed in the form of a website (vision, mission, branding, promotion, and more). We hope that Dedi Indrawan will continue to grow and be beneficial in helping more SMEs like us to develop in the future. We highly recommend using Dedi Indrawan's services. Inshaa Allah, Papanots Steak can collaborate in the future. Success and blessings for your endeavors."
